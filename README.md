# Python Certification Preparation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Python Certification Preparation repository! This repo contains resources, tutorials, and practice materials to help you prepare for Python-related certifications, such as those from Python Institute or other organizations.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x (download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/))
- Jupyter Notebook (install via pip: `pip install notebook`)
- Git (for cloning this repo)
- A Google account (for Google Colab)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/rudyhendrawn/python-course.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd python-course`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if a requirements file exists)

## Tutorials

### How to Connect a Jupyter Notebook to Google Colab

Google Colab is a free, cloud-based environment that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks without needing to install Python or Jupyter locally. It's great for learning and experimentation.

Follow these steps to upload and run a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) in Google Colab:

1. **Open Google Colab**: Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/) in your web browser and sign in with your Google account.

2. **Upload a Notebook**:
   - Click on the "File" menu at the top.
   - Select "Upload notebook".
   - Choose the .ipynb file from your computer. (You can download notebooks from this repo if needed.)

3. **Alternative: Open from GitHub** (for public repositories):
   - If the notebook is in a public GitHub repo, you can open it directly by modifying the URL:
     - Change `https://github.com/` to `https://colab.research.google.com/github/` in the notebook's URL.
     - For example: `https://colab.research.google.com/github/rudyhendrawn/python-course/blob/main/your-notebook.ipynb`
   - Click the link, and it will open in Colab.

4. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Once opened, you can run code cells by clicking the play button or pressing Shift+Enter.
   - Colab provides free GPU/TPU access for more intensive tasks.

5. **Saving Changes**:
   - Changes are automatically saved to your Google Drive.
   - To download the notebook back to your local machine: Go to "File" > "Download" > ".ipynb".

6. **Sharing**:
   - You can share the Colab notebook like any Google Doc, by clicking "Share" in the top-right corner.

This setup allows you to work on Python projects collaboratively or from any device with internet access.

## Course Structure

- **Modules**: Organized by certification topics.
- **Notebooks**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks for hands-on practice.
- **Exercises**: Quizzes and coding challenges.
