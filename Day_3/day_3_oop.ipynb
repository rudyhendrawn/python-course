    "### Class Relationship\n",

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), classes can have relationships with one another. Understanding these relationships is key to designing robust and maintainable systems. The main types of class relationships are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inheritance**: This is a \"is-a\" relationship where a child class inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from a parent class. For example, a `Dog` class can inherit from an `Animal` class.\n",
    "2. **Composition**: This is a \"has-a\" relationship where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes. For example, a `Car` class can have an `Engine` class as a component.\n",
    "3. **Aggregation**: This is a specialized form of composition where the contained objects can exist independently of the container object. For example, a `Team` class can have multiple `Player` objects, but players can exist without being part of a team.\n",
    "4. **Association**: This is a general relationship where classes are related to each other but do not have a strong ownership. For example, a `Teacher` class can be associated with a `Student` class, where teachers teach students but neither owns the other.\n",
